# A Guide with Code, Explantions and Answers to `Advent Of Code 2022`

## Important!!:
### While coding the solutions, I copy paste the puzzle input data at the beginning of the file. This, however, makes it difficult to access the solution due to a large scroll.
### I have therefore removed the input data from every file. The input data is in String form. The the variable for it (usually `input1` or the like, whenever used, has been mentioned in a comment)
### Make sure to paste the puzzle input into your file when writing the solutions!


## Other things:
### This guide is incomplete and in progress. There is no guarantee that this guide will cover all 25 pairs of problems. I will, however, try to go through as many as possible.

### My answer to each problem is stated at the beginning of the file. However, please don't just copy and paste it, it's fun to try the puzzles out on your own!
